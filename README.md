# Landing-pages
Any web page that a customer can access is a landing page, however in the context of marketing, a landing page is frequently a standalone page that serves a particular, narrow function and differentiates from your homepage or any other website. In order to increase brand recognition, landing pages are primarily used. Links to a company website or other websites are frequently included, however they are typically shown discretely and without being obtrusive. Thus, the page's content and social media sharing capabilities are key factors to take into account. The content should be interesting and/or instructive enough to compel visitors to share the page. Written text, video, still photos, interactive games, and other media are all possible forms of the content.

The landing page that I have created is for a travel website. Main motive of this landing page is to attract maximum crowd ad to generate great profits to the organizations.
